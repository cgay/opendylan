Environment Variables
=====================

Open Dylan uses a variety of environment variables to control
behavior, where to look for files, or where to place output files. In
the common case, it is not necessary to set any of these variables.

``OPEN_DYLAN_TARGET_PLATFORM``:
    Used in :doc:`cross-compilation`.

``OPEN_DYLAN_USER_REGISTRIES``:
    A list of directories controlling where to look for registry entries to
    find libraries. See :doc:`source-registries`.

``OPEN_DYLAN_USER_ROOT``:
    The directory where files generated by the compiler and IDE are placed.
    Various subdirectories are created here for artifacts created by the compiler.

    On Windows, see :doc:`windows`. On all other platforms, this defaults to
    ``./_build``.
