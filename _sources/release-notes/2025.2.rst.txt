System
------

* :gf:`resolve-file` (in the ``file-system`` module) replaces :const:`resolve-locator`
  (in the ``locators`` module) because it is fundamentally a file-system operation.

  :gf:`resolve-file` now returns the correct class of locator, a subclass of
  :class:`<file-locator>` or class:`<directory-locator>`, depending on the actual file
  type of the fully resolved file.  It previously returned an instance of the same
  class as the locator it was provided, but that is not always accurate when symbolic
  links are followed.

* :gf:`directory-contents` has a new keyword argument ``resolve-links?``.  If true,
  symbolic links are resolved as with :gf:`resolve-file`.

* :gf:`expand-pathname` is no longer called by other ``file-system`` functions. Whether
  or not to expand ``~`` or ``~user`` in a pathname is up to the user.  The function has
  been modified such that the :type:`<pathname>` comprised of the exact string ``"~"`` or
  ``"~user"`` expands to the user's home directory.  Previously these were returned as
  unexpanded instances of :class:`<file-locator>`.

  :gf:`expand-pathname` now uses the thread safe function ``getpwnam_r`` on Unix systems.

  On Windows :gf:`expand-pathname` simply returns its argument (converted to a
  :class:`<locator>` if it was a :drm:`<string>`). In a future release it will be fixed
  to do the same thing as the Unix implementation.  Previously it erroniously did the
  same thing as :gf:`resolve-locator`.

* `Issue 1408 <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1408>`_, which could result
  in an infinite loop in :gf:`link-target`, has been fixed.  In addition, the
  :gf:`link-target` function accepts a new keyword argument, ``follow-links?``, which
  specifies whether to follow all links until a non-symlink file is found (the default)
  or just return the direct target of the given symlink.
