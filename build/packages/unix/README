Welcome to Open Dylan!
======================

Open Dylan is an open source implementation of the Dylan programming
language, plus a large number of assorted libraries.

This release is Open Dylan 2020.1. We expect this release to have
bugs.  We're interested in getting your feedback, especially on
anything we can do to make the initial experience with Open Dylan run
more smoothly. You can contact us through any of the channels listed
on https://opendylan.org/community/index.html.


Requirements
============

This tarball contains the port of Open Dylan to UNIX on x86 CPUs.  So,
you should have that, or an emulation thereof, to run this distribution.
More specifically, due to the usage of thread-local storage, the
minimum requirements are:

FreeBSD:
 * FreeBSD 9

Linux:
 * Linux kernel 2.6
 * glibc 2.3

macOS:
 * Lion
 * XCode 4.2.1


Installation
============

When extracted, the tarball creates a ./opendylan-2020.1
directory. Just add `pwd`/opendylan-2020.1/bin to your PATH. For
example, if you extracted the tarball in /opt:

  $ export PATH=/opt/opendylan-2020.1/bin:$PATH    # for bash


Usage
=====

If you are new to the compiler, the Getting Started with the
Command Line Tools is recommended:
