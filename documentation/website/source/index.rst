Welcome to Open Dylan!
======================

    *Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which
    supports rapid program development.  When needed, programs can be
    optimized for more efficient execution by supplying more type
    information to the compiler.  Nearly all entities in Dylan
    (including functions, classes, and basic data types such as
    integers) are first class objects. Additionally Dylan supports
    multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword
    arguments, object introspection, macros, and many other advanced
    features...  --Peter Hinely*

For more on the background and goals of the Dylan language, see the
excellent `Introduction to the Dylan Reference Manual </books/drm/drm_6.html>`_.
