Here are some resources for keeping up with what's going on in the Dylan hacker
community...

.. _contribute:

How to Contribute
=================

The `Hacker Guide <http://opendylan.org/documentation/hacker-guide/>`_ has
details on how to contribute to the project.


.. _irc:

The #dylan IRC channel
======================

The #dylan channel on Freenode.net is where most of the day-to-day Dylan activity
takes place.  Since Dylan hackers are spread around the world (New Zealand,
Germany, East and West coast USA, South America, ...) there's usually someone
online at all times of day.  The channel is logged at
http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/dylan so you can always ask a
question and then check the logs for answers later.

Freenode also offers `web-based chat`_ if you don't have an IRC client or
just want easy and quick access.

To discuss coding issues you can `create a gist on GitHub
<https://gist.github.com/>`_ and paste a link to it in the #dylan
channel.

.. _web-based chat: https://webchat.freenode.net/

.. _mailing-lists:

Mailing List
============

dylan-lang@googlegroups.com, also `browsable on the web
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dylan-lang>`_, is dedicated
to discussion of Dylan.  If you have a question that's more detailed
or doesn't required the quick back-and-forth of IRC, this is the
preferred place for it.

`comp.lang.dylan
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.dylan/topics>`_ also exists,
but dylan-lang@ is the preferred forum.

Other Sites
===========

- `Twitter <https://twitter.com/DylanLanguage>`_
- `Google+ Community <https://plus.google.com/communities/115853148502055906760>`_
- `Stack Overflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dylan>`_
