===================
Dylan Documentation
===================

The purpose of this project is to provide searchable, browsable API
documentation based on the reference materials. The idea would be to
extract documentation into JSON by writing an extension to Sphinx, put
that JSON into something like ElasticSearch and building a web-based
user interface on top of that.
