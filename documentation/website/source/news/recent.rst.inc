  No matter if you know Dylan or not, we can help you
  `learn Dylan <http://opendylan.org/books/dpg/>`_ or put your
  other skills to use. We've got a good `list of tasks
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/wiki>`_ that we're
  collecting and some people will bring their own Dylan-related
  projects.
