**Dswank - emacs and SLIME**
*2011-12-12*

We developed DIME, the Dylan interaction mode for emacs, based
on SLIME. Now, you can browse the class hierarchy, get
argument lists, locate definitions, compile, view warnings and
more, all from within emacs!

We're revitalizing our documentation and moving to a new

looking much better and being more maintainable than

**Welcome to the New Website!**
*2011-11-22*

As part of recharging Open Dylan development, we've re-done the
website and cleaned up a lot of the old, out-dated material here.

If you're looking for some of the old material, it can be found
over at `<http://old.opendylan.org/>`_.
