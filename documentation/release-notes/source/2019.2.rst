This document describes the 2019.2 release of Open Dylan, released DD
MMM, 2019.  This release contains many enhancements and bug fixes, highlights
of which are listed below.  For complete details see `the commit logs

Compiler
========

* The default compiler-back-end is now selected by querying the
  ``SUPPORTED_COMPILER_BACK_ENDS`` build system variable, normally set
  at configuration time within the ``config.jam`` build script:

  .. code-block:: jam

      SUPPORTED_COMPILER_BACK_ENDS ?= llvm c ;

  At build time, if the selected back-end is not supported by the
  build-system configuration, a warning will be issued.

  The default back-end, when it is available, is now LLVM.

* In the LLVM back-end, improved alignment information is supplied to
  the ``llvm.memcpy`` intrinsic.

* A new ``primitive-the`` primitive function is supported as an
  annotation that allows the compiler to assume that a value has the
  given type. These annotations were also added to the ``dylan``
  library at various frequently-executed expressions where the
  compiler is otherwise unable to infer the type, reducing the number
  of run-time type checks when using the LLVM back-end.

* Optimization for cases where the ``instance?`` function is used in
  an ``if`` or ``case`` condition has been improved.

* A bug in the LLVM back-end that could cause stack overflows in
  long-running functions has been fixed.

* The C back-end now uses C99 hexadecimal floating-point constants in
  its output to prevent loss of precision due to decimal conversion.

* A `longstanding bug
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1068>`_ in an
  attempted optimization that caused spurious serious warnings when
  compiling the Dylan library has been fixed.

* A `failure <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1239>`_ of
  code generated by the LLVM back-end to detect integer overflows
  resulting from arithmetic shifts has been fixed.

Run-time
========

* An error in the LLVM run-time which prevented call-site method
  dispatch caches from being used has been fixed. This change
  significanly improves the performance of code using the LLVM
  back-end.

* Support for ``apply-mep`` method entry (which is used for calling a
  known method using ``apply()`` when next-methods are known) was
  added to the LLVM run-time.

* The interpretation of ``decode-double-float`` and
  ``encode-double-float`` on 64-bit platforms has changed, so that 32
  bits of the ``<double-float>`` value are found in each of the two
  ``<machine-word>`` values. Previously (on 64-bit platforms) the entire
  64 bits were placed in one ``<machine-word>`` and the other contained
  zeroes. This change fixes `bug 1254
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1254>`_.

CORBA
=====


Debugging
=========


Documentation
=============

* Dylan Reference Manual links were added to `An Introduction to Dylan
  <https://opendylan.org/documentation/intro-dylan/index.html>`_

* Index sections were added to `Getting Started with the Open Dylan
  IDE
  <https://opendylan.org/documentation/getting-started-ide/index.html>`_,
  `Building Applications With DUIM
  <https://opendylan.org/documentation/building-with-duim/index.html>`_.

Build System
============

* The build system now reliably detects when changes have been made to
  Jamfile sources while the environment is running.

* The ``fdmake.pl`` build tool used during bootstrapping was improved
  so that it can build multiple libraries for each invocation of
  ``dylan-compiler``, significantly reducing time required to do
  bootstrap builds.

Library Changes
===============

dylan Library
-------------


common-dylan Library
--------------------

* The simple-io module has been removed.  This module was deprecated in Open
  Dylan 2014.1 and is replaced by the simple-format module.

* The performance of the ``join`` method was improved.


io Library
----------


system Library
--------------

* Library initialization under the LLVM back-end has been changed to
  enable using the ``load-library`` function on all supported
  platforms.

* A `bug in delete-directory:file-system:system
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1227>`_ was fixed.

c-ffi Library
-------------


testworks Library
-----------------


collections Library
